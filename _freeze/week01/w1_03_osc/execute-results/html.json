| Auto-purged?  | One for each... |\n|----------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| **Home**        | `/users/`         | 500 GB / 1 M files | Yes        | No            | User            |\n| **Project**     | `/fs/ess/`   | Flexible           | Yes        | No            | OSC Project     |\n| **Scratch**     | `/fs/scratch/`    | 100 TB             | No         | After 90 days | OSC Project     |\n\nDuring the course, we will be working in the project directory of the course's OSC Project `PAS2880`: `/fs/ess/PAS2880`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Terminology\n\n- Directory is just another word for folder, often written as \"dir\" for short\n- **Paths TBA**\n:::\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n#### Login Nodes\n\nLogin nodes are set aside as an initial landing spot for everyone who logs in to a supercomputer.\nThere are only a handful of them on each supercomputer,\nthey are shared among everyone, and they cannot be \"reserved\".\n\nAs such, login nodes are meant only to do things like organizing your files and\ncreating scripts for compute jobs,\nand are ***not*** **meant for any serious computing**,\nwhich should be done on the compute nodes.\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n#### Compute Nodes\n\nData processing and analysis is done on compute nodes.\nYou can only use compute nodes after putting in a **request** for resources (a \"job\").\nThe Slurm *job scheduler*, which we will learn to use later in this course,\nwill then assign resources to your request.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### Compute node types\n\nCompute nodes come in different shapes and sizes.\nStandard, default nodes work fine for the vast majority of analyses,\neven with large-scale omics data.\nBut you will sometimes need non-standard nodes,\nsuch as when you need a lot of RAM memory or need GPUs^[GPUs are e.g. used for Nanopore basecalling].\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## At-home reading: What works differently on a supercomputer like at OSC? _(Click to expand)_\n\nCompared to command-line computing on a laptop or desktop,\na number of aspects are different when working on a supercomputer like at OSC.\nWe'll learn much more about these later on in the course, but here is an overview: \n\n-   **\"Non-interactive\" computing is common**\\\n    It is common to write and \"submit\" scripts to a queue instead of running programs interactively.\n-   **Software**\\\n    You generally can't install \"the regular way\", and a lot of installed software needs to be \"loaded\".\n-   **Operating system**\\\n    Supercomputers run on the Linux operating system.\n-   **Login versus compute nodes**\\\n    As mentioned, the nodes you end up on after logging in are not meant for heavy computing\n    and you have to *request access to \"compute nodes\"* to run most analyses.    \n:::\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n## OSC OnDemand\n\nThe OSC OnDemand web portal allows you to use a web browser to access OSC resources such as:\n\n-   A **file browser** where you can also create and rename folders and files, etc.\n-   A **Unix shell**\n-   \"**Interactive Apps**\": programs such as RStudio, Jupyter, VS Code and QGIS.\n\n{{< fa user-edit >}} **Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and log in** (use the boxes on the left-hand side)\n\nYou should see a landing page similar to the one below:\n\n![_The OSC OnDemand landing page_](img/ondemand_home.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"90%\"}\n\nWe will now go through some of the dropdown menus in the **blue bar along the top**.\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n### Files menu\n\nHovering over the **Files** dropdown menu gives a list of directories that you have access to.\nIf your account is brand new, and you were added to `PAS2880`, you should only have three directories listed:\n\n1.  A **Home** directory (starts with `/users/`)\n2.  The `PAS2880` project's \"**scratch**\" directory (`/fs/scratch/PAS2880`) \n3.  The `PAS2880` project's \"**project**\" directory (`/fs/ess/PAS2880`)\n\nYou will only ever have one Home directory at OSC,\nbut for every additional project you are a member of,\nyou should usually see additional `/fs/ess` and `/fs/scratch` directories appear.\n\n{{< fa user-edit >}} **Click on our focal directory `/fs/ess/PAS2880`**.\n\nOnce there, you should see whichever directories and files are present at the selected location,\nand you can click on the directories to explore the contents further:\n\n![_The OnDemand file browser_](img/ondemand_files_PAS2700.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"95%\"}\n\nThis interface is **much like the file browser on your own computer**, so you can also create, delete, move and copy files and folders, and even upload (from your computer to OSC) and download (from OSC your computer) files^[Though this is not meant for large (\\>1 GB) transfers. Different methods are available --- we'll talk about those later on.] --- see the buttons across the top.\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n### Interactive Apps menu\n\nWe can access programs with Graphical User Interfaces (**GUI**s; point-and-click interfaces)\nvia the **Interactive Apps** dropdown menu:\n\n![_Options in the OSC Ondemand Interactive Apps dropdown menu_](img/ondemand_apps.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"}\n\nNext week, we will start using the VS Code text editor, which is listed here as `Code Server`.\nLater, we will also use `RStudio Server` to code in R.\n\n<hr style=\"height:1pt; visibility:hidden;\" />\n\n### Clusters menu\n\n#### System Status\n\nIn the \"**Clusters**\" dropdown menu, click on the item at the bottom, \"**`System Status`**\":\n\n![_The Clusters dropdown menu_](img/ondemand_systemstatus_select.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"40%\"}\n\nThis page shows an overview of the live, current usage of the two clusters ---\nthat can be interesting to get a good idea of the scale of the supercomputer center,\nwhich cluster is being used more,\nwhat the size of the \"queue\" (which has jobs waiting to start) is, and so on.\n\n![](img/ondemand_systemstatus.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"90%\"}\n\n#### Shell Acccess\n\nInteracting with a supercomputer is most commonly done using a so-called \"Unix shell\",\nwhich is a command-line interface to a computer that we will be using throughout this course.\nStill under the **Clusters** dropdown menu (see the screenshot above),\nyou can access a Unix shell on Ascend, Cardinal, or Pitzer.\n\nI'm selecting a shell on the Cardinal cluster (`Cardinal Shell Access` item),\nwhich is the cluster we will be using throughout this course.\nThis will open a new browser tab,\nwhere the bottom of the page looks like this:\n\n![](img/ondemand_shell-cardinal.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"95%\"}\n\nWe'll return to this Unix shell next week.\n\n<br><br>\n",
