    "text": "This is the GitHub website for the course Practical Computing Skills for Omics Data (PLNTPTH 5006), a 3-credit course taught at Ohio State University during the Fall semester of 2025.\nThe course is taught by by Jelmer Poelstra from OSU’s Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC) for the Department of Plant Pathology.\n\n\nCourse description\nAs datasets have rapidly grown larger in biology, coding has been recognized as an increasingly important skill for biologists. This is especially true in “omics” research with data from e.g. genomics and transcriptomics, which typically cannot be analyzed on a desktop computer, where cutting-edge software has a command-line interface, and where workflows can include many steps that need to be coordinated.\nIn this course, students will gain hands-on experience with a set of general and versatile tools for data-intensive research in omics and beyond. The course will focus on foundational skills such as working in the Unix shell and writing shell scripts, managing software and submitting jobs at a compute cluster (the Ohio Supercomputer Center), and building flexible, automated workflows. Additionally, the course will cover reproducibly organizing, documenting, and version-controlling research projects. Taken together, this course will allow students to reproduce their own research, and enable others to reproduce their research, with as little as a single command.\n\n\n\nMore information\n\nTopics taught\n\nUnix shell: basics, scripting, running command-line programs\nR: Basics, data wrangling & visualization, Quarto, and specifics to omics data\nSupercomputer usage: basics, software, and running Slurm batch jobs\nVersion control with Git and GitHub\nReproducibility including project documentation with Markdown, project file organization, and data management\nRunning and building Nextflow pipelines\n\n\n\nCourse books\n\nAllesina S, Wilmes M (2019). Computing Skills for Biologists. Princeton UP.\nBuffalo V (2015). Bioinformatics Data Skills: Reproducible and Robust Research with Open Source Tools.
