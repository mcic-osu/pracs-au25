:::

## The main omics data types

- Genomics (including metagenomics) _DNA_
- Epigenomics _DNA modifications_
- Transcriptomics _RNA_
- Proteomics _Proteins_
- Metabolomics _Metabolites_

:::callout-note
Should be large-scale, e.g. "genomics" is largely at the "whole-genome" level. 
:::

Both genomics and transcriptomics data, in the broad definitions above,
is produced by **high-throughput sequencing** technologies.

That will be the focus of this lecture and will be used in examples throughout the course.

# Intro to sequencing technologies {background-color="dimgray"}

## What does *sequencing* refer to?

The shorthand sequencing, like in "high-throughput sequencing",
generally refers to **determining the nucleotide sequence of fragments of DNA**.

. . .

<br>

::: callout-note
#### What about RNA or proteins?

- **RNA** is usually reverse transcribed to DNA (cDNA) prior to sequencing, as in nearly all "RNA-seq".

  *Direct RNA sequencing* is possible with one of the sequencing technologies we'll discuss,
  but this is under development and not yet widely used.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- **Protein** sequencing requires different technology altogether,
  such as mass spectrometry, and is not further discussed in this lecture.
:::

## Sequencing technologies: overview

**Sanger sequencing (since 1977)**\
Sequences a single, typically PCR-amplified, short-ish (≤900 bp) DNA fragment at a time

. . .

<br>

**High-throughput sequencing (HTS, since 2005)**\
Sequences hundreds of thousand to billions, usually randomly selected,
DNA fragments at a time

<br>

Sequenced DNA fragments are referred to as "reads".

## Sequencing cost through time

# High-throughput sequencing (HTS) {background-color="dimgray"}

## Examples of HTS applications

-   **Whole-genome assembly**

. . .

-   **Variant analysis** (for population genetics/genomics, molecular evolution, GWAS, etc.):

    -   Whole-genome "resequencing"

    -   Reduced-representation libraries (e.g. RADseq, GBS)

. . .

-   **RNA-seq** (transcriptome analysis)

. . .

-   Other functional sequencing methods like **methylation sequencing, ChIP-seq,** etc.

. . .

-   **Microbial community characterization**

    -   Metabarcoding

    -   Shotgun metagenomics

## HTS applications (cont.)

![](img/lee2013.gif){fig-align="center" width="73%"}

## Examples of HTS analyses

- Algorithmic/bioinformatics stage:
  - Read QC
  - Read trimming
  - Read alignment and classification
  - Read assembly
  - Genotype calling

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

. . .

- Biostatistical stage:
  - Differential abundance among groups
  - Clustering/ordination and network analyses
  - GWAS
  - Functional enrichment

## The main HTS technologies

::::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Short-read HTS**

- Produces up to billions of 50-300 bp highly accurate reads
- Market dominated by Illumina

- Since 2005 — technology fairly stable
- _(AKA Next-Generation Sequencing - NGS)_
:::
::: {.column width="4%"}

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Long-read HTS**

- Reads much longer than in NGS but fewer, less accurate, and more costly per base
- Mainly Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)
- Since 2011 — remains under rapid development

## Read lengths

-   Short-read (Illumina) HTS: 50-300 bp reads
-   Long-read HTS: longer & more variable read lengths (PacBio: 10-50 kbp, ONT: 10-100+ kbp)

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

. . .

<details>

<summary>**When are longer reads useful?**</summary>

-   Genome assembly

-   Haplotype and large structural variant calling

-   Transcript isoform identification

-   Taxonomic identification of single reads (microbial metabarcoding)

</details>

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<details>

<summary>**When does read length not matter (as much)?**</summary>

-   SNP variant analysis

-   Read-as-a-tag: the goal is just to know a read's origin in a reference genome,
    like in counting applications such as RNA-seq

</details>

## Error rates

Currently, no sequencing technology is error-free.

- Illumina error rates are mostly below 0.1%
- **TBA**

::: callout-important
#### Error rates are changing

Error rates in one recent type of PacBio sequencing where individual fragments
are sequenced multiple times ("HiFi") *are now lower than in Illumina*.

Error rates of ONT sequencing are also continuously decreasing.
:::

. . .

<br>

::: callout-note
#### Quality scores in sequence data

When you get sequences from a high-throughput sequencer, base calls have typically already been made.
Every base is also accompanied by a quality score (inversely related to the estimated error probability).
We'll talk about those in some more detail in a bit.
:::

# Illumina libraries and sequencing {background-color="dimgray"}

## Libraries and library prep

We will talk a but about Illumina library prep because this is the most common
type of sequencing, and because throughout the course,
we will use Illumina read files as examples.

In a sequencing context,
a "**library**" is a collection of nucleic acid fragments ready for sequencing.

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

In Illumina and other HTS libraries, these fragments **number in the millions or billions** and are **often** **randomly generated** from input such as genomic DNA:

. . .

::: legend2
An overview of the **library prep** procedure.
This is typically done for you by a sequencing facility or company.
:::

## A closer look at the processed DNA fragments

As shown in the previous slide, after library prep,
each DNA fragment is flanked by several types of short sequences that together
make up the "**adapters**":

<br>

![](img/adapters2.png){fig-align="center"}

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

::: callout-note
#### Multiplexing!
Using the indices/barcodes in adapters, up to 96 samples can be multiplexed into a single library.
:::

## Paired-end vs. single-end sequencing

DNA fragments can be sequenced from both ends as shown below —   
this is called **"paired-end" (PE) sequencing**:

![](img/pairedend.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

When sequencing is instead **single-end (SE)**, no reverse read is produced:

![](img/singleend.png){fig-align="center"}

## Insert size variation

The size of the DNA fragment can vary -- both by design and because of limited
precision in size selection. In some cases, it is:

- Shorter than the *combined* read length, leading to **overlapping reads** (this can be useful):

![](img/insert_size_overlap.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

. . .

- Shorter than the *single* read length, leading to "**adapter read-through**"
  (i.e., the ends of the resulting reads will consist of adapter sequence, which should be removed):

![](img/insert_size_adapter-read-through.png){fig-align="center" width="58%"}

# Reference genomes {background-color="dimgray"}

## Genomes

Many HTS applications either **require a "reference genome"** **or involve its production.**

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

What exactly does "reference genome" refer to? It usually includes:

- **Assembly**\
  A representation of most of the genome DNA sequence: the genome assembly

- **Annotation**\
  The "annotation" that provides the *locations of genes and other genomic features*,
  as well as functional information on these features

. . .

:::callout-tip
#### Taxonomic identity

Reference genomes are typically needed and used at the **species level**.

- If needed, it is often possible to work with reference genomes of closely related species
- Conversely, multiple reference genomes may exist, e.g. for different subspecies

# Sequence file types {background-color="dimgray"}

## Overview

All common seqeunce/genomic data files are **plain-text**.
The main types are:

-   **FASTA**\
    Simple sequence files, where each entry contains a header and a DNA/AA sequence.\
    Versatile, can contain a few short sequences, entire genome assemblies, proteomes,
    and alignments.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

. . .

-   **FASTQ**\
    The standard format for **HTS reads** — contains a quality score for each nucleotide.

-   **SAM/BAM**\
    An **alignment** format for HTS reads.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

. . .

-   **GTF**/**GFF**\
    Tables (tab-delimited) with information such as genomic coordinates on
    "**genomic features**" such as genes and exons.
    The files contain reference **genome annotations**.

## FASTA files

FASTA files contain one or more DNA or amino acid sequences,
with no limits on the number of sequences or the sequence lengths.

The following example FASTA file contains two entries:

``` bash
>unique_sequence_ID Optional description
ATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAAAA
>unique_sequence_ID2
ATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAATG
```

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

Each entry contains a **header** and the **sequence** itself, where:

- Header lines start with a `>` and provide identifying information for the sequence
- The sequence is often spread across multiple lines with a fixed width

## FASTQ

FASTQ is the standard format for HTS reads.\
**Each** **read forms** **one FASTQ entry** and is represented by four lines, which contain, respectively:

. . .

1.  A **header** that starts with `@` and e.g. uniquely identifies the read
2.  The **sequence** itself
3.  A **`+`** (plus sign)
4.  One-character **quality scores** for each base (hence FASTQ as in "Q" for "quality")

![](img/fastq_header.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## FASTQ quality scores

The quality scores we saw in the read on the previous slide represent an estimate of the error probability of the base call.

Specifically, they correspond to a numeric "Phred" quality score (`Q`), which is a function of the estimated probability that a base call is erroneous (`P`):

> **Q = -10 \* log10(P)**

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

For some specific probabilities and their rough qualitative interpretation for Illumina data:

| Phred quality score | Error probability | Rough interpretation |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **10**              | 1 in 10           | terrible             |
| **20**              | 1 in 100          | bad                  |
| **30**              | 1 in 1,000        | good                 |
| **40**              | 1 in 10,000       | excellent            |

## FASTQ quality scores (cont.)

This numeric quality score is represented in FASTQ files *not by the number itself*, but by a corresponding "ASCII character".

This allows for a single-character representation of each possible score — as a consequence, **each quality score character can conveniently correspond to (& line up with) a base character** in the read.

. . .

| Phred quality score | Error probability | ASCII character |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **10**              | 1 in 10           | `+`             |
| **20**              | 1 in 100          | `5`             |
| **30**              | 1 in 1,000        | `?`             |
| **40**              | 1 in 10,000       | `I`             |

::: callout-tip
#### A rule of thumb
In practice, you almost never have to manually check the quality scores of bases in
FASTQ files, but if you do, a rule of thumb is that letter characters are good (Phred of 32 and up).
:::

## FASTQ (cont.)

FASTQ files have no size limit, but in paired-end (PE) sequencing,
forward and reverse reads are **split into two files**:\
forward reads contain `R1` and reverse reads contain `R2` in the file name.

For example, having paired-end FASTQ files for 2 samples could look like this:

``` bash
# A listing of (unusually simple) file names:
sample1_R1.fastq.gz
sample1_R2.fastq.gz
sample2_R1.fastq.gz
sample2_R2.fastq.gz
```

## Overcoming sequencing errors

Sequencing every bases multiple times,
i.e. having a \>1x so-called "**depth of coverage**" allows to infer the correct sequence:

![](img/coverage2.jpg){fig-align="center" width="45%"}

. . .

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

- Overcoming sequencing errors is made more challenging by natural
  **genetic variation** among and within individuals.
- Typical depths of coverage: at least 50-100x for genome assembly; 10-30x for resequencing.
