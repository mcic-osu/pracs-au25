## Goals for this session

This session will provide an introduction to high-performance computing in general
and to the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) more specifically. 

This is only meant as a brief overview to give context about
the working environment that we will start using next week:
we will do all of our coding and computing at OSC during this course.
During the course, you'll learn a lot more about most topics touched on in this page ---
week 6 and 7 in particular focus on OSC.

## High-performance computing

A **supercomputer** (also known as a "compute cluster" or simply a "**cluster**")
consists of many computers that are connected by a high-speed network,
and that can be _accessed remotely_ by its users.
In more general terms,
supercomputers provide high-performance computing (**HPC**) resources.

This is what Cardinal, one of the OSC supercomputers, physically looks like:

![_The Cardinal OSC cluster_](img/cardinal_photo.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Here are some possible reasons to use a supercomputer instead of your own laptop or desktop:

-   Your analyses take a long time to run, need large numbers of processors,
    or a large amount of memory.
-   You need to run an analysis many times.
-   You need to store a lot of data.
-   Your analyses require software available only for the Linux operating system, but you have Windows.
-   Your analyses require specialized hardware, such as GPUs (Graphical Processing Units).

**When you're working with omics data, many of these reasons typically apply.**
This can make it hard or sometimes simply impossible to run all your analyses on your
personal workstation, and supercomputers provide a solution.

#### The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)

The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) is a facility provided by the state of Ohio.
It has several supercomputers, lots of storage space,
and an excellent infrastructure for accessing these resources.

::: {.callout-note}
#### OSC websites and "Projects"

OSC has **three main websites** --- we will mostly or only use the first:

-   **<https://ondemand.osc.edu>**: A web portal to use OSC resources through your browser (*login needed*).
-   <https://my.osc.edu>: Account and project management (*login needed*).
-   <https://osc.edu>: General website with information about the supercomputers, installed software, and usage.

----

Access to OSC's computing power and storage space goes through **OSC "Projects"**:

-   A project can be tied to a research project or lab, or be educational like this course's project, `PAS2880`.
-   Each project has a budget in terms of "compute hours" and storage space^[
    But we don't have to pay anything for educational projects like this one.
    Otherwise, for OSC's rates for academic research,
    see [this page](https://www.osc.edu/content/academic_fee_model_faq).].
-   As a user, it's possible (and common) to be a member of multiple different projects.

## The structure of a supercomputer center

### Terminology

Let's start with some (super)computing terminology,
going from smaller things to bigger things:

-   **Node**\
    A single computer that is a part of a supercomputer.
-   **Supercomputer / Cluster**\
    A collection of connected computers.
    OSC currently has three: "Ascend", "Cardinal", and "Pitzer".
-   **Supercomputer Center**\
    A facility like OSC that has one or more supercomputers.

### Supercomputer components

We can think of a supercomputer as having three main parts:

- **File Systems**: Where files are stored (these are shared between the OSC supercomputers!)
- **Login Nodes**: The handful of computers everyone shares after logging in
- **Compute Nodes**: The many computers you can reserve to run your analyses

We wil briefly discuss these below,
and come back to them in more detail later in the course.

![_The structure of a supercomputer with three main components: file systems, login nodes, and compute nodes_ ](img/cluster_overview_ed.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### File systems

OSC has several distinct file systems:

| File system | Located within "path" | Main purpose
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Project**     | `/fs/ess/`   | Main storage location
| **Scratch**     | `/fs/scratch/`    | Additional, temporary storage
| **Home**        | `/users/`         | General, personal files not tied to research projects or courses

During the course, we'll work in the project folder of the course's OSC Project
`PAS2880`: `/fs/ess/PAS2880`.

#### Paths?
Paths, like those shown in the table above,
specify the locations of folders and files on a computer.
You will learn more about them in the next few weeks.
:::

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Login Nodes

Login nodes are set aside as an initial landing spot for everyone who logs in to a supercomputer.
There are only a handful of them on each supercomputer,
they are shared among everyone, and they cannot be "reserved".

As such, login nodes are meant only to do things like organizing your files and
creating scripts for compute jobs,
and are ***not*** **meant for any serious computing**,
which should be done on the compute nodes.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Compute Nodes

Data processing and analysis is done on compute nodes.
You can only use compute nodes after putting in a **request** for resources (a "job").
The Slurm *job scheduler*, which we will learn to use later in this course,
will then assign resources to your request.

## What works differently on a supercomputer like at OSC? _(Click to expand)_

Compared to command-line computing on a laptop or desktop,
a number of aspects are different when working on a supercomputer like at OSC.
We'll learn much more about these later on in the course, but here is an overview: 

-   **"Non-interactive" computing is common**\
    It is common to write and "submit" scripts to a queue instead of running programs interactively.
-   **Software**\
    You generally can't install "the regular way", and a lot of installed software needs to be "loaded".
-   **Operating system**\
    Supercomputers run on the Linux operating system.
-   **Login versus compute nodes**\
    As mentioned, the nodes you end up on after logging in are not meant for heavy computing
    and you have to *request access to "compute nodes"* to run most analyses.

## OSC OnDemand

The OSC OnDemand web portal allows you to use a web browser to access OSC resources such as:

-   A **file browser** where you can also create and rename folders and files, etc.
-   A **Unix shell**
-   "**Interactive Apps**": programs such as RStudio and VS Code

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and log in** (use the boxes on the left-hand side).

Once logged in, you should see a landing page similar to the one below:

![_The OSC OnDemand landing page_](img/ondemand_home.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

We will now go through some of the dropdown menus in the **blue bar along the top**.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Files menu

Hovering over the **Files** dropdown menu gives a list of directories that you have access to.
If your account is brand new, and you were added to `PAS2880`, you should only have three directories listed:

1.  A **Home** directory (starts with `/users/`)
2.  The `PAS2880` project's "**project**" directory (`/fs/ess/PAS2880`)
3.  The `PAS2880` project's "**scratch**" directory (`/fs/scratch/PAS2880`) 

You will only ever have one Home directory at OSC,
but for every additional project you are a member of,
you should usually see additional `/fs/ess` and `/fs/scratch` directories appear.

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Click on our focal directory `/fs/ess/PAS2880`**.

Once there, you should see whichever directories and files are present at the selected location,
and you can click on the directories to explore the contents further:

![_The OnDemand file browser_](img/ondemand_files_PAS2700.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}

This interface is **much like the file browser on your own computer**, so you can also create, delete, move and copy files and folders, and even upload (from your computer to OSC) and download (from OSC your computer) files^[Though this is not meant for large (\>1 GB) transfers. Different methods are available --- we'll talk about those later on.] --- see the buttons across the top.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Interactive Apps menu

We can access programs with Graphical User Interfaces (**GUI**s; point-and-click interfaces)
via the **Interactive Apps** dropdown menu:

![_Options in the OSC Ondemand Interactive Apps dropdown menu_](img/ondemand_apps.png){fig-align="center" width="20%"}

Next week, we will start using the VS Code text editor, which is listed here as `Code Server`.
Later, we will also use `RStudio Server` to code in R.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Clusters menu

#### System Status

In the "**Clusters**" dropdown menu, click on the item at the bottom, "**`System Status`**":

![_The Clusters dropdown menu_](img/ondemand_systemstatus_select.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

This page shows an overview of the live, current usage of the two clusters ---
that can be interesting to get a good idea of the scale of the supercomputer center,
which cluster is being used more,
what the size of the "queue" (which has jobs waiting to start) is, and so on.

![A screenshot of the "System Status" page showing live cluster usage.](img/ondemand_systemstatus.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

#### Shell Acccess

Interacting with a supercomputer is most commonly done using a so-called "Unix shell",
which is a command-line interface to a computer that we'll use throughout the course.
Still under the **Clusters** dropdown menu (see the screenshot above),
you can access a Unix shell on Ascend, Cardinal, or Pitzer.

{{< fa user-edit >}} Select a shell on the Cardinal cluster (`Cardinal Shell Access` item).

This will open a new browser tab,
where the bottom of the page looks like this:

![A Unix shell on the Cardinal cluster as accessed through OSC OnDemand. OSC prints some information like file usage quota, and at the bottom of the screen is the prompt where you can type commands.](img/ondemand_shell-cardinal.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}

We'll return to this Unix shell next week.
