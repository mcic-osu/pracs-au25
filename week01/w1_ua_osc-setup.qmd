### Overview

Before Thursday's session, you should make sure that you have access to the
Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), and the OSC Project for this course (PAS2880).

### Background

You will do much of your work during this course through your browser
at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).
To access OSC, you will need to have an account.
This course has its own OSC "Project",
and membership of this specific project will allow you to access our
shared files and to reserve computing resources.

### What you should do

After completing the pre-course survey (LINK TBA),
you will receive an invitation email from OSC referencing the course's project
number PAS2880:

- **If you don't have an OSC account yet**\
  Follow the instructions in the email to sign up for OSC and accept the invitation.
  
- **If you already have an OSC account**\
  The email will likely tell you that you have been added to the project and don't have to do anything.

- **In either case, check whether you can log in**\
  Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and log in by typing your username and password
  on the left-hand side of the page.
  If you just created your account, it may take up to half an hour or so before you can log in.

_If you have any questions about this or run into problems, don't hesitate to contact Jelmer._
