## Readings

This week's reading is Chapter 2 of our secondary book,
"Bioinformatics Data Skills" ("Buffalo" for short -- the author is Vince Buffalo),
which deals with project organization and (file) management.

The chapter also contains several tips and tricks for using the shell for
project organization,
which we will work through in the Zoom sessions.
For more material along these lines, optional reading is Buffalo Chapter 3.
