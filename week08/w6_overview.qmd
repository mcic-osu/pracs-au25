## Content overview

In this final week with new content,
you will be learning about informal and formal (bioinformatics analysis) pipelines,
and using a best-practice pipeline written with the Nextflow workflow management system
by the nf-core initiative.

#### Some of the things you will learn this week

- Get a better understanding of the purpose and mechanics of "runner scripts".
- What challenges you can run into when creating analysis pipelines
  with regular Bash scripts, including runner scripts.
- What "workflow management systems" like Snakemake and Nextflow are,
  and what the advantages of formal pipelines written with these are.
- What the nf-core initiative is, and how you can run one of their pipelines at OSC.
